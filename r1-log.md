# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 9, Saturday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today, I spent a couple of hours reading about web frameworks and deciding if I want to try learn d3 or deploy my visualization on a python server. 

### R1D2
Kept reading about how to make things interactive on the web. Potentially bokeh might be enough for the visualization I want, but if I'm going to sink time into learning JS maybe it;d be best to make it d3 anyway...

### R1D3
Made a working bokeh JS map with selector dropdown.

### R1D4
More bokeh JS hacking.

### R1D5
Met with Milo to talk about data viz tool and path forward.
